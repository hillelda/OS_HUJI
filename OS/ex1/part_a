The program opens a directory ./welcome_dir_1, and than opens another
directory, ./welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir_2 in the first one, both with 0777
permissions (full permissions).
Then, the program allocates memory with the brk command. (let the program read
and write from a certain segment of the heap).
Then, the program opens a file welcome_file.txt in the previous dir:
"./welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir_2/", for write only, creates the file if doesn't
exist, and truncate if does. The file with 666 permissions (full read/write
permission but no execute).
Then, the program opens the /etc/localtime file, for read purpose (and with
close at exec flag, meaning it will close in the next exec). It reads
from the file into buffer (twice), followed by two fstat calls that returns
information about the and /etc/localtime file. Between the read commands, it
changes the /etc/localtime file offset using lseek. Then it closes the
/etc/localtime file.
Next, the program use fstat to retrieve inforamtion about welcome_file.txt,
it writes "welcome to OS-2023" into it, closes it, and deletes it.
Then the program tries to delete /welcome_dir_2, but gets an error because
its a directory. Then the program removes it successfully. The same process
happens with /welcome_dir_1 (error in delete and remove).
Finally, the program exits with exit-code 0.
